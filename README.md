## Description 

This is a simple application that asks the user what team members are part of their team, and then takes their response and creates an HTML file with a compiled view of this team. I created it to experiment with node.js, modularization, classes, and constructor methods. To create it, I essentially created classes for the different types of employees that could be entered into the team, then created an inquire process that asks the user for details about the employee members on their team. After, the user's input data is compiled and rendered to an HTML file using a combination of modularized HTML templates for the different types of employees.
